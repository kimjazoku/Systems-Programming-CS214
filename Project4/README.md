Our server allows concurrent games.

We did the following to stress test our program:
- We ran multiple RPS games at the same time to ensure concurrency
- We disconnected one user while waiting in queue for a game and reconnected to ensure the server was able to update the player wait list in real time
- We disconnected mid game (or at any point throughout the match) to ensure that forfeit was being thrown properly
- We made sure the program exits if one player chooses to quit after the game concludes
- We did not allow improperly formatted messages to be passed through the server
- We also used the provided test file (the revised version of course)
